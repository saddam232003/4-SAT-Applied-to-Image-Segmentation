Instructions for Running Code
1.	Save the code in a file called sat_segmentation.py.
2.	Make sure all packages are installed using pip.
3.	Run with: python sat_segmentation.py
You’ll see three outputs:
•	Original mask
•	Corrupted mask (simulating missing labels)
•	Reconstructed mask using SAT solving
